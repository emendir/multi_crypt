In this library, a family of cryptographic algorithms is a collection of different sets of compounded algorithms for performing cryptographic operations that use intercompatible public & private keys because they share the same algorithm for the first layer in their cryptographic stacks.

## Functions:

Each module must provide the following functions and a string `FAMILY_NAME`:

_Use the code from ./crypto_family_template.py to get started on building your own module, it contains a few more useful details than this here._

```

The functions that take keys as inputs must be able to process all possible keys generated by the family's generate_keys() function, independently of their configuration options.

## Optional Arguments
### Function `generate_keys`:
You can give `generate_keys` any keyword arguments that you want, or none.
The `keylength` argument is just used here as an example.
### Arguments `encryption_options` and `signature_options`:
You must implement these keyword arguments, because they manifest multi_crypt's concept of separating the user-relevant first-layer algorithms (cryptography families) from the various algorithms and protocols compounded on them for hybrid cryptography.
